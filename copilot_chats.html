Full chronological chat transcript (raw)

--- USER: Initial request ---
Scrub these three pages for Pittsburgh Steelers player data (Wikipedia season page and steelers.com roster) and a databayou colleges list, then produce CSVs for draft picks, free agents, roster, and colleges and a combined table.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Confirmed CSV names and schema; created a todo list; asked clarifying questions.

--- USER ---
Requested separate CSVs plus combined, include team_status, omit county, put files in repo root.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Downloaded and inspected the three sources (databayou HTML + data CSV, steelers.com roster HTML, Wikipedia season HTML) to determine parsing approach.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Added `scrape_steelers_data.py` and `requirements.txt`, then ran the scraper against the saved pages and databayou CSV. Produced `draft_picks.csv`, `free_agents.csv`, `current_roster.csv`, `colleges.csv`, and `combined_table.csv`.

--- USER ---
Mentioned encoding issue reading databayou CSV (UTF-8 decode error).

--- ASSISTANT ---
Switched databayou read to latin1; improved parsing heuristics for Wikipedia draft table (colspan/traded rows) and roster structure.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Improved roster parsing to filter non-player links and normalize group headers to position abbreviations.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Matched roster players to Steelers site mapping to fill missing college names; matched player college names to databayou college records (best-effort token/substring match) and generated `combined_table.csv`.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Added `csv_to_sqlite.py` and created `combined_table.db` with table `combined_table` and an index on `name`.

--- USER ---
Asked about Stanford missing address; provided Stanford address.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Updated `college_raw.csv` for Stanford to `450 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305`, regenerated `colleges.csv` and `combined_table.csv`, rebuilt `combined_table.db`, verified Andrus Peat row.

--- USER ---
Asked to add Leaflet support / map.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Added `generate_players_geojson.py` (reads `queries.sql` and `combined_table.db`, writes `players.geojson`) and `static/index.html` (Leaflet + markercluster) viewer. Noted `players.geojson` needed to be generated and files served over HTTP.

--- USER ---
Asked to start local server and open map (Live server preferred).

--- ASSISTANT ---
Started `python3 -m http.server 8000` and opened `static/index.html` in host browser; noted favicon 404 (harmless).

--- USER ---
Requested webapp changes: search bar above map, markers for players by college location, search by player/college/position; prioritize `combined_table.db` and `queries.sql`.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Planned Flask backend + static frontend; added `app.py` and frontend files; later converted to frontend-only per user request.

--- USER ---
Requested frontend only; expressed problem with file listing.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Converted to front-end only app; updated `static/app.js` to load `players.geojson` directly; regenerated `players.geojson`.

--- USER ---
Requested mapping improvements: remove duplicate draft markers when a player also appears as Player; merge positions for players with multiple positions; draw lines for transfers.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Updated `generate_players_geojson.py` to deduplicate by name and prefer status Player > Free Agent > Draft; merged positions with slash-joined string; regenerated `players.geojson` (62 features).

--- USER ---
Requested revert to single-marker behavior; do not track multiple colleges.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Reverted generator and frontend to single-marker per player; regenerated `players.geojson`.

--- USER ---
Asked what Python `requests` does; assistant explained.

--- USER ---
Provided URL https://bendazz.github.io/football-analytics-project/ and asked to check `Final_Project2.docx` for missing requirements from that page.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Installed `python-docx`, fetched the site, extracted headings and list items, compared keywords, and reported missing items; suggested additions: tools list, scraping evidence, SQL examples, CSV sample rows, deployment URL, reproducibility instructions.

--- USER ---
Asked to update webpage to add dropdown 'Report' showing Final_Project2.docx contents and 'Copilot Chats' to show every chat; assistant added `report.txt` and `copilot_chats.txt` and dropdown UI.

--- USER ---
Requested full raw chronological chat transcript and to render contents as HTML; also requested dropdown style: black background with yellow text for dropdown names and for the chats and the reports.

--- ASSISTANT ---
Preparing to export full transcript and render HTML; will not edit DOCX.
